# Starbucks Capstone
This project fulfills a requirement for the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree program. The purpose of this analysis was to determine the extent to which Starbucks' promotional offers change customer purchasing behavior. For write up of these results, see this Medium article: https://andrew-lee.medium.com/understanding-the-impacts-of-starbucks-promotions-c9a9db5da807

# Installation
The analysis was done using Python 3.8.5

The following libraries were used:
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- math
- json
- matplotlib
- scipy

# Project Motivation and Summary
This analysis set out to understand whether Starbucks' promotional offers affect customer spending habits. A within-subjects analysis was used to compare customers' purchase history during offer periods to their baseline periods, which were defined as the time period prior to customers receiving a promotion.

We can confidently conclude that the promotions do have a statistically significant and substantive impact on customer spending habits. All three offer types appear to drive higher customer purchasing activity. Looking within subgroups, female and high income customers respond most strongly to the offers.
